Parametric filament spool desiccant tube.

This tube can be filled with loose desiccant pearls and placed in the center hole of a filament
spool, to keep it dry during storage.
It has a dense grid of square holes on all sides, which allows air to flow through the tube and
reach the desiccant pearls.

The lid can be put on the tube and secured by a short twist.

#### Models

As different filament spools have different center hole diameters and widths, there are multiple
models available.

I pre-rendered models for all the filament spool types I have at home right now. If you need any
other, you can generate them with OpenSCAD or the thibgiverse customizer.
